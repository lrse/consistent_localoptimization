function Rob = integrateMotion(Rob, Tim)

%INTEGRATEMOTION Integrate Robot motion, with covariance.
%   ROB = INTEGRATEMOTION(ROB, TIM) performs one prediction motion step to
%   the state and covariance of robot Rob, following the motion model in
%   Rob.motion. Structure Rob is updated. The time information Tim is used
%   only if the motion model requires it, but it has to be provided because
%   MOTION is a generic method.
%
%   The following motion models are supported:
%       'odometry'   uses function odo3()
%       'constVel'   uses function constVel()
%   Edit this file to add new motion models.
%
%   See also MOTION, SIMMOTION, CONSTVEL, ODO3, UPDATEFRAME.
